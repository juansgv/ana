# ana.world - Project Development Flow

## Project Origin

The ana.world project originated from a workspace in [Grok.com](https://grok.com) named "ANA". This workspace was created to design and develop a project management tool specifically tailored for architects managing multiple building projects in Bogota, Colombia.

The initial concept was developed collaboratively using Grok's AI features to define the requirements, technology stack, and implementation plan for a comprehensive application that would help organize and streamline architecture project management.

## Development Timeline

### Phase 0: Ideation and Planning (Grok.com)
- Created workspace "ANA" in Grok.com
- Drafted comprehensive requirements based on user needs
- Explored technical options and architecture alternatives
- Generated the detailed `plan.md` file outlining the entire project scope, technology stack, and implementation phases

### Phase 1: Initial Setup (May 16, 2025)
- Created GitHub repository ([juansgv/ana](https://github.com/juansgv/ana))
- Set up Go module structure with Gin framework
- Implemented initial backend API structure for task management
- Created frontend using HTMX and Tailwind CSS with terra color palette
- Configured proper routing for API and static files
- Documented next steps in `next.md`

## Development Approach

Our development approach follows these principles:

1. **Planning-Driven**: Each phase is carefully planned with clear deliverables
2. **Iterative Development**: Features are built iteratively with feedback loops
3. **API-First Design**: Backend APIs are designed first, then frontend components
4. **Documentation-Rich**: Key decisions and implementation details are documented

## Current Status & Flow

### Documentation Flow
1. **plan.md**: The comprehensive project plan generated from Grok.com workspace
2. **next.md**: Detailed implementation plan for the upcoming development phase
3. **flow.md**: Documentation of the project's evolution and development process
4. **README.md**: Bilingual project overview and setup instructions

### Code Structure Flow
1. Backend API development (Go/Gin)
2. Frontend components development (HTMX/Tailwind)
3. Database integration (PostgreSQL)
4. Authentication implementation

### Next Steps
The immediate next steps are documented in `next.md`, with the primary focus on:
1. PostgreSQL database integration
2. Authentication system implementation
3. Enhanced task management features
4. Deployment preparation

## Collaboration Workflow

We maintain a clear workflow for continuing development:

1. Review the project plan (`plan.md`) for overall direction
2. Follow the implementation steps in `next.md` for current tasks
3. Document decisions and architecture changes in this flow document
4. Update README.md with any new setup instructions or features
5. Commit changes with clear, descriptive commit messages
6. Use feature branches for new functionality

## Technical Choices Rationale

The technical stack (Go, HTMX, PostgreSQL, Netlify) was chosen based on:

1. **Performance Requirements**: Go provides excellent performance for backend operations
2. **Simplicity**: HTMX reduces frontend complexity without sacrificing interactive capabilities
3. **Reliability**: PostgreSQL offers robust data storage with excellent Go support
4. **Deployment Ease**: Netlify simplifies deployment and CI/CD workflows
